* Bearly Tolerable Jokes is an entertainment website that combines hilarious jokes with adorable images of bears from around the world.
* The site is a simple two button page: one button allows the user to genearte a new joke & bear pic while the other button navigates the user to learn more about a specific type of bear.
* Bearly Tolerable Jokes utilizes HTML, CSS, Foundation, and Java script to function.
* Future development for site includes the following:
  - Add a text input box for users to search for the type of joke that they would like to see.
  - Add a map to show users the region that the displayed bear originates from.
